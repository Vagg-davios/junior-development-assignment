# junior-software-assignment

This is an assignment for an entry PHP developer job @ **Epignosis**. It was quite the journey. I did not know that PHP had evolved so much, so there was basically a whole lot of learning on the fly. There's a few things I did not get to add like tests and a few edge-case handlers due to limited time so those will be later on.

## Project structure
As most MVC frameworks, this project flows through `public/index.php` and loads the correspondant page base on the URL
```
php-mvc/
    .idea/              # PHPStorm set-up
    data/               # SQL database file
    public/             # Accessible files. What final users see
        .htaccess       # Make src/ unaccessible for users
        index.php       # Starting point for the entire app
        robots.txt
    src/                # Application source code
        config/         # Database credentials, utility functions, routing table
        Controller/     # Controller folders (book & user controllers)
        Core/           # Middleware classes, Database class, Router class, Validator class
        Model/          # Model classes
        View/           # Views
        .htaccess       # Restrict access to /src
    vendor/             # Composer files, autoloader !ignored
    .gitignore          # Files/folders to be ignored by version control
    .htaccess           # Redirect everything to public/ folder
    composer.json       # Composer dependency file
```
